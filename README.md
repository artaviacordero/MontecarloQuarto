# Montecarlo Quarto

This is a implementation of the game Quarto for a human player to play against the machine.

The machine uses a MonteCarlo Tree Search (MCTS) to determine the steps to follow.

The exploration time of the search and the exploitation threshold can be configured for testing and optimizing its value.
